## LG TODOS
- upgrade the plugins api to match changes in webpack 4.0.0-alpha.
  - where can we reference the api or find what to change?
- update the plugin documentation to for [webpack2](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/) to be as comprehensive as [webpack1](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html)
- Get webpack on [Up-For-Grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/)
