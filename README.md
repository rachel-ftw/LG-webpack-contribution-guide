# LG Webpack Contribution Guide
A (WIP) guide for first time contributors to the webpack ecosystem.

1. Familiarize yourself with how you contribute to Open Source generally. If you've never contributed or worked on a big project, look over some of the resources on how to do that. The `Free Code Camp` link is particularly jucy and coprehensive. Contributing to opensource for the first time can be overwhealming! Don't panic. It's ok, we're here for you. 
    - Free Code Camp: [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)
    - [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
    - Open Source Guides: [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
1. Familiarize yourself with how Webpack works. If you've never worked with webpack do the [Getting Started tutorial](https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/). If you already know what webpack does, now it's time to get under the hood. It's way easier to contribute when you have an idea of what's *actually happening* in the project you're working on.
1. Look over available PR's

## WEBPACK ISSUES


## TODOS & NOTES
- upgrade the plugins api to match changes in webpack 4.0.0-alpha.
  - ** 12/12: apparently many of these have been done. Search and find any additional to contribute to.
  - where can we reference the api or find what to change?
  - [CONTEXT: issue - webpack 4.0.0-alpha.0 feedback](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6064)
  - [feat(tapable): upgrade Single|Multi|DynamicEntryPlugin to tapable v1 #6078](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/6078/files)
  - [Improve `PluginEnvironment` helper to support tapable's hooks #6079](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/6079)
- find libraries within the webpack ecosystem to upgrade to es6 syntax.
- update the plugin documentation to for [webpack2](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/) to be as comprehensive as [webpack1](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html)

**Expanding Wepack's Availability and Ease of Contribution**

- Get webpack on [Up-For-Grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/)
- Optimize issue tags to suit searching.
