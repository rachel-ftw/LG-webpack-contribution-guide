# LG Webpack Contribution Guide
A (WIP) guide for first time contributors to the webpack ecosystem.



You too can start contributing to open source in just a few easy steps...
1. Familiarize yourself generally with contributing to Open Source. If you've never contributed or worked on a big project, look over some of the resources on how to do that. The `Free Code Camp` link is particularly jucy and coprehensive. Contributing to opensource for the first time can be overwhelming. Don't panic! We're here for you.

    - Open Source Guides: [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

    - [Webpack's Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    
1. Familiarize yourself with how Webpack works. If you've never worked with webpack do the [Getting Started tutorial](https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/) so you can understand what it's like to work with. If you already know what webpack does, now it's time to get under the hood. It's way easier to contribute when you have an idea of what's *actually happening* in the project you're working on.

## TODOS & NOTES
- upgrade the plugins api to match changes in webpack 4.0.0-alpha.
  - ** 12/12: apparently many of these have been done. Search and find any additional to contribute to.
  - where can we reference the api or find what to change?
  - [CONTEXT: issue - webpack 4.0.0-alpha.0 feedback](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6064)
  - [feat(tapable): upgrade Single|Multi|DynamicEntryPlugin to tapable v1 #6078](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/6078/files)
  - [Improve `PluginEnvironment` helper to support tapable's hooks #6079](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/6079)
- find libraries within the webpack ecosystem to upgrade to es6 syntax.
- update the plugin documentation to for [webpack2](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/) to be as comprehensive as [webpack1](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html)
